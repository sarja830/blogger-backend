#### JPA's cascade = REMOVE and Hibernate's @OnDelete used together?
Let's say you have a one-to-one directional relationship
```java
class House {

    @OneToOne
    Object door;

}
```
If you use CascadeType.REMOVE then deleting the house will also delete the door.
```java
    @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.REMOVE)
    Object door;
```
If you use @OnDelete then deleting the door will also delete the house.
```java
    @OneToOne
    @OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)
    Object door;
```
