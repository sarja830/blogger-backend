5. get the access keys for the bucket and update the application.properties file

### backend deployment:
1. The project is build on java 17
2. export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17` run this command if needed
3. Run a build locally using. ```mvn clean package``` with the updated properties
4. Refer https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker
5. On the server run the following commands to deploy the application

```shell
  export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17`
  mvn clean package
  docker build  -t blog/backendappv1 .
```


   ```shell
   //github token
   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
   
   //go to demo folder
   cd blogger-backend/demo
   // to build a local image
   docker build  -t blog/backendappv1 .
   // to run the local image
   
    docker run  -it -d --network=host -p 8080:8080 blog/backendappv1 

   
   cd .
   // to list the old images
   
   docker images
   
   // to list all the containers  (docker ps) for running containers
   docker ps -a  
   docker rm  1af15e84ae97 skajdewrfdqwe
   // list images 
   docker images
   docker image rm 1af15e84ae97 
    ```



### frontend deployment:
# React + Vite

For production build
``` JavaScript
//to create a production build)
npm run build

//to serve the production build
serve -s dist -l 4000

// in production serve using pm2 ~/blogger-frontend/client# pm2 serve dist 5173
 pm2 serve dist 5173

#if already running then restart the server 
  pm2 restart  static-page-server-5173 

    
```

// to stop a running docker container
docker stop image_id
// to remove a runnign docker container
docker rm image_id


NGINX etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```shell

 location  /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/api/; #whatever port your app runs on
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

   }

 location / {

#### JPA's cascade = REMOVE and Hibernate's @OnDelete used together?
Let's say you have a one-to-one directional relationship
```java
class House {

    @OneToOne
    Object door;

}
```
If you use CascadeType.REMOVE then deleting the house will also delete the door.
```java
    @OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.REMOVE)
    Object door;
```
If you use @OnDelete then deleting the door will also delete the house.
```java
    @OneToOne
@OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)
    Object door;
```
